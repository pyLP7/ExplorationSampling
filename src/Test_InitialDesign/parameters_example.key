$- This model has been developed under a contract with the Federal Highway
$- Administration (FHWA) by a Team which is now at the Center for Collision
$- Safety and Analysis at the George Mason University (GMU).
$-
$- The FE model is based on a 2012 TOYOTA CAMRY and has been validated
$- for available impact test configurations.
$-
$- The model is continuously updated to improve its capabilities in
$- predicting responses in various impact scenarios.  However, the user must
$- verify his own results.  Neither CCSA, GMU, FHWA or NHTSA assume any
$- responsibility for the validity, accuracy, or applicability of any results
$- obtained from this model.
$-
$- We ask that the CCSA at GMU and the FHWA be acknowledged for any use of
$- this FE model resulting in papers and publications.
$-
$- Please feel free to contact us with any suggestions, comments, or
$- questions.
